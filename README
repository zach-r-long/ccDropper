To build follow these steps:

** Move ccDropper directory inside the phenix tree
     phenix/app 

** make bin/ccDropper

** Add to path by sourcing install script
   This can either be done as normal user then pass PATH env var to sudo when calling phenix
   Or just sudo su and source the install.sh script

Application will generate a log file at /tmp/ccDropperLog to help debug issues
